# About Me😎😎
**[Actively seeking full-time opportunities in 2025]**

As a Northeastern University graduate student pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science, my journey has led me to the forefront of technological innovation at **Tesla**, where I contribute as a Full-Stack Software Engineer Intern. Leveraging my expertise in Angular CLI and ASP.NET Core, I focus on building robust front-end solutions and reliable back-end systems.

Previously, my role as a Full-Stack Software Engineer Intern at **Kaiser Permanente** honed my skills in delivering comprehensive web applications. My drive is to continuously develop software that enhances user experiences, aligns with strategic business goals, and fosters collaborative growth within my team and the broader tech community.
